We spin a wheel that retuns a value with a particular probability
distribution. What's the expected number of spins before we
equal or exceed a target value?

roulette_unform.py - uniform [0,1] distribution

Theoretical results are e^x spins for the target x with 0 <= x <=1,
2*target+2/3 as x gets large. The remainder approaches the
distribution 2*(1-x) with 0 <= x <=1.

roulette_exponential.py - exponential distribution with lambda=1

Theoretical results are x+1 spins for the target x as x gets large;
the remainder approaches the same exponential distribution.
